# Roda das Emoções - Accordion Layout

## Overview
The "Roda das Emoções" project is an interactive web application designed to help users explore and reflect on their emotions using an accordion layout. This layout allows users to select emotions and their corresponding intensities in a user-friendly manner.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the accordion layout for selecting emotions and their intensities. It includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
  
- **css/styles.css**: Contains the styles for the accordion layout, including styles for the emotions, intensities, and overall layout of the application.
  
- **js/app.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling the accordion functionality. It manages the display of emotions and their corresponding intensities, as well as the transitions between different steps of the emotional reflection process.
  
- **data/emotions.js**: Exports the data structure containing the emotions, their intensities, and associated sub-emotions. It serves as the source of truth for the emotional data used in the application.
